# Data Subject Rights Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

The Data Subject Rights implementation has been successfully completed, addressing the GDPR compliance requirements for handling data subject requests. This implementation provides a comprehensive system for managing user data rights including access, rectification, erasure, portability, and restriction requests.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced GDPR Service (`src/lib/compliance/gdpr-service.ts`)

**New Methods Added:**
- `getDataSubjectRequests(userId?, patientId?)` - Retrieve requests for a specific user/patient
- `getAllDataSubjectRequests(status?, limit, offset)` - Admin method to get all requests with pagination
- `updateDataSubjectRequestStatus(requestId, status, processedBy, notes, responseData)` - Update request status
- `processDataSubjectRequest(requestId, processedBy)` - Automatically process requests based on type
- `getDataSubjectRequestStatistics()` - Get metrics for dashboard

**Request Processing Logic:**
- **Access Requests**: Automatically export user/patient data in JSON format
- **Portability Requests**: Export data in portable format
- **Erasure Requests**: Anonymize/delete user data while maintaining referential integrity
- **Rectification Requests**: Mark for manual review and processing
- **Restriction Requests**: Mark for manual review and restriction setup

### 2. Compliance Metrics Integration (`src/lib/compliance/index.ts`)

**Fixed Data Subject Request Metrics:**
- Replaced hardcoded zeros with actual statistics from database
- Real-time calculation of total, pending, completed, and overdue requests
- Integration with compliance dashboard for monitoring

### 3. Enhanced Privacy Center (`src/components/compliance/PrivacyCenter.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- **Request Submission**: Users can submit different types of data subject requests
- **Request History**: Display of user's previous requests with status tracking
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status indicators for pending, in-progress, completed, and rejected requests
- **Request Details**: Detailed view of each request including dates, notes, and processing information

### 4. Data Subject Request Manager (`src/components/compliance/DataSubjectRequestManager.tsx`)

**New Admin Component:**
- **Request Management**: Admin interface for viewing and processing all data subject requests
- **Filtering & Search**: Filter by status and search by email, name, or request ID
- **Pagination**: Handle large numbers of requests efficiently
- **Status Updates**: Update request status with notes
- **Automated Processing**: One-click processing for access, portability, and erasure requests
- **Overdue Alerts**: Visual indicators for overdue requests (past 30-day GDPR deadline)

### 5. Updated Compliance Dashboard (`src/components/compliance/ComplianceDashboard.tsx`)

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Real Metrics**: Display actual data subject request statistics
- **Quick Actions**: Direct link to data subject request manager
- **Overdue Alerts**: Warning when there are overdue requests
- **Management Links**: Easy navigation to request management interface

### 6. Updated Compliance Page (`src/pages/Compliance.tsx`)

**New Tab:**
- Added "Data Requests" tab with proper RBAC permissions
- Integrated DataSubjectRequestManager component
- Role-based access control for GDPR management features

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the existing `data_subject_requests` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE data_subject_requests (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    request_type data_subject_request_type NOT NULL,
    requester_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    requester_name TEXT,
    patient_id UUID REFERENCES patients(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    status request_status DEFAULT 'pending',
    description TEXT,
    verification_token TEXT UNIQUE,
    verified_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    processed_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    response_data JSONB,
    notes TEXT,
    due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Key Features

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ **30-day processing deadline** - Automatic due date calculation and overdue tracking
- ✅ **Request verification** - Email verification system for request authenticity
- ✅ **Audit trail** - Complete logging of all request processing activities
- ✅ **Data export** - Comprehensive data export in machine-readable format
- ✅ **Right to erasure** - Safe data deletion with referential integrity
- ✅ **Data portability** - Export data in portable JSON format

### User Experience
- ✅ **Self-service requests** - Users can submit requests through Privacy Center
- ✅ **Status tracking** - Real-time status updates and history
- ✅ **Request types** - Support for all GDPR data subject rights
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** - Works on all device sizes

### Admin Experience
- ✅ **Centralized management** - Single interface for all requests
- ✅ **Automated processing** - One-click processing for standard requests
- ✅ **Search and filtering** - Easy request discovery and management
- ✅ **Overdue monitoring** - Alerts for requests approaching or past deadline
- ✅ **Bulk operations** - Efficient handling of multiple requests

## Request Processing Workflow

1. **User Submission** → User submits request through Privacy Center
2. **Verification** → Email verification sent to requester
3. **Admin Review** → Request appears in admin dashboard
4. **Processing** → Automated or manual processing based on request type
5. **Completion** → User notified and data provided/action completed
6. **Audit** → All actions logged for compliance reporting

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created (`src/test/compliance-data-subject-requests.test.ts`) covering:
- ✅ Request submission and verification
- ✅ Status updates and processing
- ✅ Metrics calculation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Component integration
- ✅ Service method functionality

## Security & Privacy

- **Data minimization** - Only collect necessary information for request processing
- **Access control** - RBAC permissions for admin functions
- **Audit logging** - Complete audit trail of all request activities
- **Secure deletion** - Safe data anonymization preserving system integrity
- **Verification** - Email verification prevents unauthorized requests

## Performance Considerations

- **Pagination** - Efficient handling of large request volumes
- **Indexing** - Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Caching** - Metrics caching for dashboard performance
- **Async processing** - Non-blocking request processing
